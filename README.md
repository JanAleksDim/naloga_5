#naloga 5

I included bootstrap in the head element via .css and javascript files.

I also found menu examples on bootstraps which I used to make menus in the Header, main body and the footer.

I divided the main section into three collums, which behave resposively depending on the size of the window. On mobile they stack vertically.
